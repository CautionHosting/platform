**For open source projects, personal use, and non-commercial use:**

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

### What this means:

- You can use, modify, and distribute this software for free
- You can run this software as a service
- **You must share ALL source code** of your modified version
- **You must share ALL code that uses this software as a library**
- **If you run this software as a service, you must share your full source code** (including modifications) to your users

The AGPL-3.0 includes the "network use" clause, which means if you run this software as a hosted service, you must provide the complete source code to anyone who interacts with it over a network.

**This is perfect for:**
- Open source projects that already share their code
- Personal projects and learning
- Academic research
- Contributing back to the community

**This may NOT work for:**
- Businesses wanting to keep their infrastructure proprietary
- Companies offering competing PaaS services
- Organizations with proprietary modifications

## Commercial License

**For businesses, proprietary use, and hosted services:**

If you want to use this software in a proprietary product, run it as a service without sharing your source code, or integrate it into commercial software, you need a commercial license.

### Commercial license benefits:

- ✅ Keep your code proprietary
- ✅ No obligation to share modifications
- ✅ Run as a hosted service without source code disclosure
- ✅ Priority support
- ✅ Legal protection and indemnification
- ✅ Custom features and consultation

### Pricing:

Pricing is based on:
- Number of users/organizations
- Deployment scale (self-hosted vs. managed service)
- Support level required
- Custom feature development

## Why Dual License?

We believe in open source software, but we also recognize that some organizations need the flexibility to keep their modifications private. The dual license model allows:

1. **Open source projects** to benefit from this software for free
2. **Commercial users** to use this software without AGPL obligations
3. **Sustainable development** through commercial license revenue
4. **Everyone** to benefit from improvements and bug fixes

## FAQ

### Q: I'm a business. Do I need a commercial license?

**A:** It depends:
- If you're comfortable sharing ALL your code (including infrastructure code, deployment scripts, etc.), you can use the AGPL version
- If you want to keep ANY part of your implementation private, you need a commercial license
- If you're running this software as a service for others, you likely need a commercial license

### Q: I want to contribute code. Which license applies?

**A:** By contributing to this software, you agree to license your contributions under both AGPL-3.0 and the commercial license. This allows us to offer both license options. See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.

### Q: Can I fork this software and offer it under a different license?

**A:** You can fork under AGPL-3.0, but:
- Your fork must remain AGPL-3.0
- You must share all source code
- You cannot relicense as proprietary
- You cannot remove the AGPL requirements

### Q: I'm using this software internally at my company. Do I need a commercial license?

**A:** If you're only using this software internally and not offering it as a service to others, AGPL allows this as long as you're willing to share your source code with anyone who has network access to your software instance. Most companies prefer a commercial license to keep internal modifications private.

### Q: What about SaaS companies using this software?

**A:** The AGPL specifically covers the SaaS use case. If you offer this software as a hosted service, you must provide your complete source code to users. Most SaaS companies choose our commercial license instead.

### Q: Can I use this software to deploy proprietary applications?

**A:** Yes! The applications you deploy ON this software remain yours with their own licenses. This license only covers this software itself and modifications to this software. Your applications are not affected.

### Q: What if I'm a non-profit or educational institution?

**A:** Contact us! We offer special pricing for non-profits, educational institutions, and open source projects. Many qualify for free commercial licenses.

## License Compliance

If you use this software under AGPL-3.0, you must:

1. **Include license notices**: Keep all copyright and license notices intact
2. **Provide source access**: Make your complete source code available to users
3. **Document modifications**: Clearly mark any changes you've made
4. **License downstream**: Any distributed modifications must be AGPL-3.0
5. **Offer network access to source**: If running as a service, provide source code download

Failure to comply with AGPL-3.0 automatically terminates your license to use this software.

## Changing Licenses

You can change from AGPL to commercial license at any time by purchasing a commercial license. Contact us to discuss your needs.
